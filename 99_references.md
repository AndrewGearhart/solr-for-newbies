# Sample data

File `data/books.json` contains 10,000 books taken from Library of Congress' [MARC Distribution Services](https://www.loc.gov/cds/products/marcDist.php).

TODO: document how I created `data/books.json` from the original MARC data.

TODO: Do I need the larger set with 250K books? or a smaller one?
